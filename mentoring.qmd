# Mentoring


#### A guide for mentors

Analyst Network North East recognises the value of mentoring, for analysts at all career stages. If you are interested in being a mentor, please get in touch! 

## Introduction

This guide is designed for mentors, providing an introduction to mentoring, its principles, and roles. It offers insights into what mentoring is, how it differs from coaching, and the benefits it can bring to mentors.

## What is mentoring?

Mentoring is a relationship in which someone more experienced supports the development of someone less experienced, or new to a profession. It can be a one-time experience or a long-term relationship, focusing on mutual development, with equal power and responsibilities.

## Distinction between Coaching and Mentoring

Coaching emphasises high performance and specific goals, while mentoring has a broader focus, encompassing personal and professional development.

## Overriding Principles

Mentoring is voluntary, confidential, and occurs outside the mentee's direct management chain. It can occur within or outside the mentee's organisation. The relationship is based on mutual influence and learning.

## Benefits of Mentoring

Mentor Benefits:

- Improved performance
- Increased business activity and networking
- Enhanced communication
- Greater job satisfaction, loyalty, and self-awareness

Wider Benefits:

The mentor's role varies but typically includes helping the mentee gain knowledge and skills, understand the profession, navigate internal politics, question attitudes, overcome obstacles, and embrace change. Mentors may serve as confidants, networkers, role models, and counselors.

## Advice for Mentors

Mentor Qualities:

Tips for Mentors:

- Maintain regular contact
- Be honest
- Avoid being judgmental
- Don't expect to have all the answers
- Help the mentee access resources and support
- Establish clear expectations and boundaries
- Respect confidentiality

## Cycle of Mentoring

The First Meeting:

The initial meeting sets the tone, allowing both mentor and mentee to get to know each other, discuss expectations, and identify areas for development.

Ground Rules:

Establish ground rules, including confidentiality and communication frequency. A written mentoring contract can formalize the relationship.

Subsequent Meetings and Reviewing Progress:

At each meeting, review progress and responsibilities. Encourage the mentee to set the agenda and share their development plan.

Ending the Mentoring Relationship:

The relationship ends when the mentee no longer requires regular contact. Reasons for closure include changes in roles, promotions, departures, or the relationship no longer working effectively.


## The Role of the Mentor

Mentors can take on various roles during the mentoring process, including:

- Counselor: Helping the mentee work through motivations and intentions, solve problems, and make decisions.
- Coach: Focusing on specific goals and actively supporting the development of skills and attitudes.
- Facilitator: Assisting in making things happen by recognising potential barriers and providing advice on overcoming them.
- Leader: Leading by example, demonstrating best practices, and sharing a vision while being adaptable in the mentoring approach.
- These roles are used as needed throughout the mentoring relationship to support the mentee's development effectively.
