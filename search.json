    "text": "Analyst Network North East recognises the value of mentoring, for analysts at all career stages. If you are interested in being a mentor, please get in touch!\n\n\n\nThis guide is designed for mentors, providing an introduction to mentoring, its principles, and roles. It offers insights into what mentoring is, how it differs from coaching, and the benefits it can bring to mentors.\n\n\n\nMentoring is a relationship in which someone more experienced supports the development of someone less experienced, or new to a profession. It can be a one-time experience or a long-term relationship, focusing on mutual development, with equal power and responsibilities.\n\n\n\nCoaching emphasises high performance and specific goals, while mentoring has a broader focus, encompassing personal and professional development.\n\n\n\nMentoring is voluntary, confidential, and occurs outside the mentee’s direct management chain. It can occur within or outside the mentee’s organisation. The relationship is based on mutual influence and learning.\n\n\n\nMentor Benefits:\n\nImproved performance\nIncreased business activity and networking\nEnhanced communication\nGreater job satisfaction, loyalty, and self-awareness\nLeadership development\nPositive attitude toward change\nImproved motivation\nAcquisition of new knowledge and skills\n\nWider Benefits:\n\nImproved staff retention for organisations\nEnhanced morale, motivation, and relationships\nFosters a knowledge-sharing culture\nImproved business performance\nIncreased productivity\nEnhanced communication\nTalent identification and management\n\nThe mentor’s role varies but typically includes helping the mentee gain knowledge and skills, understand the profession, navigate internal politics, question attitudes, overcome obstacles, and embrace change. Mentors may serve as confidants, networkers, role models, and counselors.\n\n\n\nMentor Qualities:\n\nStrong interpersonal and communication skills\nBroad organizational knowledge\nRelevant competencies and skills\nCompetence in counseling, coaching, facilitating, and leadership\nWillingness to co-responsibility for mentee’s development\nTime management ability\nPositive attitude toward mentoring\nExperience in developing others\nWillingness and ability to learn\n\nTips for Mentors:\n\nMaintain regular contact\nBe honest\nAvoid being judgmental\nDon’t expect to have all the answers\nHelp the mentee access resources and support\nEstablish clear expectations and boundaries\nRespect confidentiality\n\n\n\n\nThe First Meeting:\nThe initial meeting sets the tone, allowing both mentor and mentee to get to know each other, discuss expectations, and identify areas for development.\nGround Rules:\nEstablish ground rules, including confidentiality and communication frequency. A written mentoring contract can formalize the relationship.\nSubsequent Meetings and Reviewing Progress:\nAt each meeting, review progress and responsibilities. Encourage the mentee to set the agenda and share their development plan.\nEnding the Mentoring Relationship:\nThe relationship ends when the mentee no longer requires regular contact. Reasons for closure include changes in roles, promotions, departures, or the relationship no longer working effectively.\n\n\n\nMentors can take on various roles during the mentoring process, including:\n\nCounselor: Helping the mentee work through motivations and intentions, solve problems, and make decisions.\nCoach: Focusing on specific goals and actively supporting the development of skills and attitudes.\nFacilitator: Assisting in making things happen by recognising potential barriers and providing advice on overcoming them.\nLeader: Leading by example, demonstrating best practices, and sharing a vision while being adaptable in the mentoring approach.\nThese roles are used as needed throughout the mentoring relationship to support the mentee’s development effectively."

    "text": "Our very first ANNEcdote is with Hollie Johnson, data scientist at Newcastle University’s National Innovation Centre for Data, and in her spare time, committee member for our Analyst Network North East.\nOn a typical autumnal November afternoon, Elliott White (ANNE secretary and deputy chair) jumped onto a Google Meets call with Hollie, to talk about her path from maths enthusiast to data scientist, what she now gets up to during her day to day, and what advice she would offer people interested in pursuing a similar role. On we go… Starting at the start, Hollie’s passion for maths sparked whilst learning maths at school. “I have enjoyed maths for as long as I can remember”. In particular, Hollie leaned in on some of her learning at school, and how she had an “unusually” great time learning about the Fibonacci Sequence.” From there, she progressed onto a maths degree at Newcastle University where she graduated with a BSc. But it was whilst studying at University that Hollie’s “wiggly” career path kicked into action, from her interests in power lifting and circus training.\n“After graduating I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I dabbled with a few roles. I worked as a Support tutor. This is where I got to go to lectures with other students from different subjects, and help them take notes. This was great because I got to attend a whole bunch of civil engineering lectures that I would never have got to attend otherwise. Then this opportunity came up to join the Commonwealth youth circus, which was part of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games. We spent about eight months training and developing a circus show. And then we toured around Scotland with the Queen’s baton relay. I had a fantastic time doing that.”\nFollowing the Commonwealth games, Hollie returned to her passion for maths. She got stuck into a masters in computer science, whilst working part-time for a software development company. This then progressed into a PhD programme, which she completed as part of Newcastle University’s Centre for Doctoral Training on cloud computing, where she completed her PhD in 2020. Following a stint working with Tombola on its back-end gaming engine. Hollie moved into her current data science role at the National Innovation Centre for Data in 2021. “I’d seen what the National Innovation Centre for Data we’re doing and I felt like that was a direction I wanted to go and pursue, and do data science with businesses.” In her role at NICD, Hollie has got the opportunity to use her technical and non-technical skills. Typically Hollie will be working on three or four different projects at a time, with different businesses across the North East and the UK.\nHollie blends her skills in programming and data science, with teaching and coaching skills to help upskill people operating with the businesses she is partnering with. Her involvement in a project with a company managing second-life battery and energy storage systems served as a noteworthy experience. “It was a real business problem they wanted to understand,” she recalls. “We helped the team in the real-time application of their data analysis, guiding them through the subtleties of decision-making in the process.” More recently, Hollie has been working on a collaborative project with a business, to develop a dashboard, and collaborating on its development and use with the client via the cloud, using docker.\nTowards the end of our conversation, we discussed what advice Hollie might offer to others, seeking a career in data science. “Data science doesn’t need more people who have done tech all their life. Being the most technical person in the room will only get you so far. Especially in a world of generative AI. Data science needs more people with a wide range of experiences which can be leveraged to think critically and creatively to solve problems. I think data science could be a role for anyone who wants to get into those sorts of problem solving roles. More broadly, don’t be afraid to ask difficult questions. Often, the most value I can provide as a data scientist is through being able to ask challenging questions and getting people to think about the answers.”\n\n\n\nPhoto: John Donoghue for NICD"
