    "text": "In another first, Analyst Network North East hosted our first live ANNEcdote at our Spring Conference. Marie Conlon, lead analyst for resource modelling and analysis in the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) told us all about herself, her career journey and what she gets up to day to day, using analysis to improve the way DWP runs itself.\nOn we go…\nTo get us started, Marie gave us an introductory tour of her 32-year career in the civil service. Initially joining on a temporary contract in an operations role, Marie then migrated into corporate service / change roles within the organisation. During these early years, Marie told us how she developed a deep connection with what became DWP, and how the work it does, really matters to customers and society more widely.\nIn 2001, having initially studied Geography, Marie completed a MSc in Computing Science. Combining a move from the North East to London, with the learning she gained from her MSc, Marie became a member of the Government Operational Research Service (GORS). Marie felt that OR was for her, as it was the best placed profession, to help her fix things and solve problems. And it was also the place where you got to choose the best suited techniques for the problems you face every day.\nFollowing her move into GORS, Marie worked in several areas within DWP. She contributed to the Department’s work tackling fraud and error and supporting housing benefit payments. Marie also helped to develop DWPs pensions policy, where she took a secondment to contribute to the creation of the National Employment Savings Trust, part of the roll out of automatic enrolment. Marie also spent several years working at the Department for Education before in 2015, returning to her roots, at DWP, in the North East. Today, Marie leads a team of analysts and non-analysts who are responsible for forecasting staffing needs within DWP. She told us how this work is vital to ensure the organisation can deliver pension and benefit payments to its customers.\nThe role itself came about, following a review Marie led in 2019, into DWPs approach to workforce planning and analysis. It produced several recommendations, and Marie is now responsible, with her job share, for delivering many of them. Marie’s team focus their efforts on measuring the time and effort required for DWPs operational workforce to complete tasks. And using that evidence to forecast available supply needs and whether it is enough to deal with the demands on DWPs services. In this work, Marie emphasised the importance of building a robust evidence base, so that the data used, and the assumptions made, which feed a range of demand and supply forecasting models, are robust. Marie also talked about the challenges of this work. Particularly where there is change in operational processes, which can make it challenging to maintain continuity and robustness in the underlying evidence base.\nIn support of this technical work, Marie also emphasised the importance of good stakeholder management, with people, within and beyond DWP. Marie told us how she prioritises this activity, and noted how important it is to build and maintain trust. And for some external stakeholders, such as HM Treasury, Marie and her team will facilitate open book exercises, to ensure everyone understands the basis of the forecasts produced by the Department.\nOf course, everything doesn’t always go to plan all the time. And Marie shared her experience of having to adapt, at pace, to the demands of the covid-19 pandemic on DWP. Marie described how the pandemic created 2 million extra customers, almost overnight. And she highlighted the value of impact assessments, done at pace, to give the Department insight into whether easements it planned to put in place for operational processes, would give the Department a chance to meet the substantial spike to demand, it was facing. In light of this, and other experiences, Marie and her team continue to develop work in the area of sensitivity analysis. She talked about how this enables the Department to produce a best forecast, but within a reasonable range. Marie talked about how this analysis helps the Department to continually consider how it can handle expected demand, as well as how it could adapt to instances of increased and/or stressed demand.\n\n\n\nMarie speaking to Elliott at the ANNE Spring Conference\n\n\nMarie also talked about the journey the Department has been on, replatforming the tools it uses to produce its forecasts. When Marie started, much of the analysis was undertaken was SAP. Since then, Marie and her team have migrated into Excel, and more recently, are looking to migrate further into a SAS environment. Looking ahead, Marie talked about areas of development she is particularly excited about. She talked about how her team are starting to look at IT data, to observe how large groups of people in operations work and manage their cases. This additional source of data, although quite complex in nature with a lot of nuance, is providing a new insight which DWP can use to refine its assumptions. In this work, Marie and her team are being careful not to identify individuals. Rather, focusing the use case on the development of organisation wide planning assumptions.\nTowards the end of our conversation, Marie talked about some of the barriers she has faced in her career to date. Marie talked about the advantages of working as an analyst in government. She talked about how she loves the analyst community, and how people can debate the issues based on their knowledge and expertise, rather than their grade. And she talked about how opportunities to progress are, and remain to this day, open. Equally, Marie identified how there are more opportunities to progress in London – particularly at more senior levels – when compared to Newcastle. This is something Marie has come to accept, although we did both agree, that the level of opportunity for analysts today in the North East, is significantly better than it was, just 10 years ago. Marie also talked about her experiences of imposter syndrome during her career and how she realised this could be a barrier to her progression/development and how important it was to recognise that and work on resolving it. Marie then turned to offer some advice to people seeking a career in analysis. She talked about how her own experience was based on following her own interests (i.e. a love of solving problems). And this is something she would advocate others to follow. Marie advised us all to prioritise stakeholder management, and to think carefully about how you are going to work with them. And finally, Marie emphasised the importance of coming up with proportionate answers to the challenge given. Better to do “good enough” analysis in a timely manner, than a perfect analysis which is too late to make a difference.\nMarie sat down in conversation with Elliott White (ANNE committee secretary and deputy chair), at the Catalyst, Newcastle University on Wednesday 27 March 2024."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Our very first ANNEcdote is with Hollie Johnson, data scientist at Newcastle University’s National Innovation Centre for Data, and in her spare time, committee member for our Analyst Network North East.\nOn a typical autumnal November afternoon, Elliott White (ANNE secretary and deputy chair) jumped onto a Google Meets call with Hollie, to talk about her path from maths enthusiast to data scientist, what she now gets up to during her day to day, and what advice she would offer people interested in pursuing a similar role. On we go… Starting at the start, Hollie’s passion for maths sparked whilst learning maths at school. “I have enjoyed maths for as long as I can remember”. In particular, Hollie leaned in on some of her learning at school, and how she had an “unusually” great time learning about the Fibonacci Sequence.” From there, she progressed onto a maths degree at Newcastle University where she graduated with a BSc. But it was whilst studying at University that Hollie’s “wiggly” career path kicked into action, from her interests in power lifting and circus training.\n“After graduating I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I dabbled with a few roles. I worked as a Support tutor. This is where I got to go to lectures with other students from different subjects, and help them take notes. This was great because I got to attend a whole bunch of civil engineering lectures that I would never have got to attend otherwise. Then this opportunity came up to join the Commonwealth youth circus, which was part of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games. We spent about eight months training and developing a circus show. And then we toured around Scotland with the Queen’s baton relay. I had a fantastic time doing that.”\nFollowing the Commonwealth games, Hollie returned to her passion for maths. She got stuck into a masters in computer science, whilst working part-time for a software development company. This then progressed into a PhD programme, which she completed as part of Newcastle University’s Centre for Doctoral Training on cloud computing, where she completed her PhD in 2020. Following a stint working with Tombola on its back-end gaming engine. Hollie moved into her current data science role at the National Innovation Centre for Data in 2021. “I’d seen what the National Innovation Centre for Data we’re doing and I felt like that was a direction I wanted to go and pursue, and do data science with businesses.” In her role at NICD, Hollie has got the opportunity to use her technical and non-technical skills. Typically Hollie will be working on three or four different projects at a time, with different businesses across the North East and the UK.\nHollie blends her skills in programming and data science, with teaching and coaching skills to help upskill people operating with the businesses she is partnering with. Her involvement in a project with a company managing second-life battery and energy storage systems served as a noteworthy experience. “It was a real business problem they wanted to understand,” she recalls. “We helped the team in the real-time application of their data analysis, guiding them through the subtleties of decision-making in the process.” More recently, Hollie has been working on a collaborative project with a business, to develop a dashboard, and collaborating on its development and use with the client via the cloud, using docker.\nTowards the end of our conversation, we discussed what advice Hollie might offer to others, seeking a career in data science. “Data science doesn’t need more people who have done tech all their life. Being the most technical person in the room will only get you so far. Especially in a world of generative AI. Data science needs more people with a wide range of experiences which can be leveraged to think critically and creatively to solve problems. I think data science could be a role for anyone who wants to get into those sorts of problem solving roles. More broadly, don’t be afraid to ask difficult questions. Often, the most value I can provide as a data scientist is through being able to ask challenging questions and getting people to think about the answers.”\n\n\n\nPhoto: John Donoghue for NICD"
